# Mobile-Price-Range-Prediction

This is the Capstone project which is a part of my Data Science training at AlmaBetter.

A Machine Learning project to predict a price range indicating how high the price of a mobile when the specifications of a mobile are given.


We studied the entire dataset we had found all the important information on the data we were going to work on

1.The Data Preprocessing

2.Description of Data

3.Info about the data

4.The Correlation between the attributes

5.The attributes that are most correlated with the Price Range ( Our target )

6.Outlier Analysis of Non-categorical Data

7.Histogram of all the attributes

Next we tried a total of 7 Machine Learning Algorithms for each we made a confusion matrix and the most contributing features were found

1.Logistic Regression

2.Decision Tree

3.Random Forest

4.KNN

5.Naive Bayes

6.SVM

7.XGB

From all the above experiments we can conclude that logistic regression and XGBoosting with using hyperparameters we got the best results.
